**Problem:** [Valera and X](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/404/A)

*Cross posted on [UIUC ICPC website](http://icpc.cs.illinois.edu/)*

**Solution:**
For each character, we are trying to find the maximum number \\(c\\)
such that this character appears in every string at least \\(c\\) times.

Iterate through each string and count the frequency of each character.
Take the minimum frequency of each character across all strings.

At last, print the lexicographically smallest string composed of these
characters, where each character appears its minimum frequency number of times.

**Complexity:** O(\\(\|S\|\\)) where \\(\|S\|\\) is the total string length.

**Source Code:**
{% highlight C++ %}
{% raw %}
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    vector<int> common;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        string S;
        cin >> S;

        vector<int> letter(26);
        for (int j = 0; j < S.size(); j++)
            letter[S[j] - 'a']++;

        if (i == 0)
            common = letter;
        else 
            for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++)
                common[j] = min(common[j], letter[j]);
    }

    string out;
    for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++)
        for (int j = 0; j < common[i]; j++)
            out += (char)(i + 'a');
    cout << out << "\n";
    return 0;
