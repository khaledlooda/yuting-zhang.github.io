**Problem:** [Marathon](http://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/404/B)

*Cross posted on [UIUC ICPC website](http://icpc.cs.illinois.edu/)*

**Solution:**
The hardest part of this problem is about using floating point. 
Dealing with floating point numbers is very tricky due to precision issues, 
so if it is possible, by all means we should
somehow convert floating point numbers into regular integers. 

One hint in the problem statement is that both \\(a, d\\) have at most
4 digits after the decimal point. This means we can simply multiply
the floating point numbers by 10000 to get the same integer representations.
After that, we can directly deal with integers.

Another thing to notice is that the output size of this problem is kinda large,
so use fast IO (for example, scanf, printf in C++) can help speed things up.
**Time Complexity:** O(\\(n\\))

**Complexity:** O(\\(n^2\\))

**Source Code:**
{% highlight C++ %}
{% raw %}
#include <cstdio>
#include <cmath>

using namespace std;

int main() {
    double orig_a, orig_d;
    scanf("%lf %lf", &orig_a, &orig_d);

    long long a = round(orig_a * 1e4), d = round(orig_d * 1e4), n;
    scanf("%lld", &n);
    
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        long long rem = d * i % (4 * a);

        if (rem < a) 
            printf("%f %f\n", rem / 1e4, 0.0);
        else if (rem < 2 * a)
            printf("%f %f\n", a / 1e4, (rem - a) / 1e4);
        else if (rem < 3 * a)
            printf("%f %f\n", (a - (rem - 2 * a)) / 1e4, a / 1e4);
        else
            printf("%f %f\n", 0.0, (a - (rem - 3 * a)) / 1e4);
    }
}
