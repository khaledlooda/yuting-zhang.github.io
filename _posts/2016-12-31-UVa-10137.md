**Problem:** [The Trip]

**Solution:**
This problem is not as easy as it seems to be.

First, to get rid of precision error, we can store everything as cents,
so we will only need to use integers.

Then, since the total money spent may not be a multiple of the number 
of students, the exact average may not be an integer. From the problem
statement we know that a one-cent difference is allowed, so we can 
construct the algorithms this way.

Let \\(lower = \lfloor{avg}\rfloor\\), \\(upper = \lceil{avg}\rceil\\).
Then to meet the requirement, we will need to let every student
who had spent money less than \\(lower\\) to give out more money until 
the money spent has reached \\(lower\\). This is the minimum money
transfer required  for these people to reach \\(lower\\).

Similarly, we let every student
who had spent more money than \\(upper\\) to receive money until their
spent becomes \\(upper\\). This is the minimum money transfer required 
for these peopel to reach \\(upper\\).

However, due to the fact that we are not
using the true average, the amount of money given and the amount of money
received calculated from the above algorithm
may not be the same. As a result, we take the greater of these two
to ensure that everyone will end up with money spent within 
\\([lower, upper]\\).

int main() {
    int n;
    while (scanf("%d", &n) && n) {
        vector<int> money(n);
        int total = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int dollar, cent;
            scanf("%d.%d", &dollar, &cent);
            money[i] = dollar * 100 + cent;
            total += money[i];
        }
        
        int upper = ceil(1.0 * total / n);
        int lower = total / n;

        int smaller = 0, larger = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
            if (money[i] < lower)
                smaller += lower - money[i];
            else if (money[i] > upper)
                larger += money[i] - upper;

        int solution = max(smaller, larger);

        printf("$%d.", solution / 100);
        if (solution % 100 < 10)
            printf("0");
        printf("%d\n", solution % 100);
    }
    return 0;
