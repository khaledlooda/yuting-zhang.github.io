Ahoy visitors! I am Yuting Zhang, currently studying Computer Science at 
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 

Computer Science has always been a fascinating subject for me, as I really
enjoy using Computer Science to  model and solve real life problems from
such an abstract, yet also practical way. 

One of my fields of interest is related to algorithms, data structures, and 
ways to model seemingly tough problems into solvable Mathematical models. 
To improve my skills, I often participate in competitive programming 
competitions at all levels, and practice different kinds of problems 
from various Online Judges. The main bulk of this website consists of 
solutions to those problems.

Aside from algorithms and data structures, I have also found big data and
artificial intelligence to be rather intriguing. Currently this is also the 
technical track I am pursuing.
