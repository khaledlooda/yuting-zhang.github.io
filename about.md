Ahoy visitors! I am Yuting Zhang, currently studying Computer Science at University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign. Computer Science has always been a fascinating subject for me, and I really
enjoy using Computer Science to  model and solve real life problems from such an
abstract, but yet also practical way. 

My current interest are mostly Algorithms, Data Structures, and various ways to model seemingly tough
problems into solvable Mathematical models. To improve my skills, I oftentimes participate in 
 competitive programming competitions of all levels, and  practice different kinds of problems 
from various Online Judges. I will also post some of my solutions on this website to log my progress,
as well as to provide a guide for people who seek some hint.

To be honest, I am still exploring different fields of Computer Science, 
and my plan is to further explore the fields of big data and artificial 
intelligence, as well as security in near future.
