Ahoy visitors! I am Yuting Zhang, currently studying Computer Science at University of Illinois
at Urbana-Champaign. Computer Science has always been a fascinating subject for me, and I really
enjoy using Computer Science to  model and solve real life problems from such an
abstract, but yet also practical way. 

My current interest are mostly Algorithms, Data Structures, and various ways to model seemingly tough
problems into solvable Mathematical models. To improve my skills, I oftentimes participate in 
 competitive programming competitions of all levels, and  practice different kinds of problems 
from various Online Judges. I will also post some of my solutions on this website. 
Many pro competitive programmers prefer to use macros, short variable names, and many other
practices which are only suitable in competitive environments, and post their hardly readable
solutions online without much explanation. Although I sometimes also use such strategies in competitions,
all solutions I post here will be formatted and documented in a much clearer way.

To be honest, I am still exploring different fields of Computer Science, 
and my plan is to further explore the fields of big data and artificial 
intelligence, as well as security in near future.
